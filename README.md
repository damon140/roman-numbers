# roman-numbers

This is a tiny library for reading and writing Roman numbers, offered under LGPL v3 license.  Includes upper and lower and some unicode varients that are more than one character.

I was curious about Roman numbers and some of the variations after a visit to the Collosseum in Rome on holiday.  So I wrote some code about it.

This code doesn't have the synthetic numerals for 4 and 9 etc which other libraries do, if this is important to you.
